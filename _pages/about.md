I will be spending the summer in sunny San Jose, CA as an intern at ABB!

I am a second year PhD student in the Mechanical Engineering department at Virginia Tech. My advisor is Prof. [Dylan Losey](https://dylanlosey.com/), and I spend most of my time working in [Collab](https://collab.me.vt.edu/). 

Prior to joining Virginia Tech, I was employed as a Robotics Engineer at Parker Hannifin Corporation, and before that I received my MS in Robotics Engineering from the Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), MA.

My current research is in the areas of Robot Learning and Human Robot Interaction.
